### Data Flow

1. **Voice Interaction**:
   ```
   User Taps Mic → Record Audio → Transcribe → AI Response → Speak Result
   ```

2. **Document Explanation**:
   ```
   Take/Choose Photo → OCR Text Extraction → AI Summary → Speak Summary
   ```

3. **Reminders**:
   ```
   Natural Language Input → Parse Time → Schedule Notification → Alert User
   ```

4. **Fall Detection**:
   ```
   Monitor Motion → Detect High-G Event → Check Inactivity → Alert Family
   ```

## 🚀 Next Steps to Deploy

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Run on Development Device
```bash
npm start
# Or for iOS specifically:
npm run ios
```

### 3. Test Core Features
- **Voice Assistant**: Grant microphone permission, tap to talk
- **Explain**: Grant camera/photos permission, snap a document
- **Reminders**: Create reminders with natural language
- **Fall Detection**: Enable in Settings > Safety Features

### 4. Production Integration Required

The app is currently using **mock implementations** for these services:

#### A. AI Service Integration
Replace mocks in `src/services/aiService.ts` with:
- **OpenAI API** (GPT-4o) for conversational responses
- **Google Vision API** or **AWS Textract** for OCR
- Configure your API keys and endpoints

#### B. Backend Setup
Per `TECHNICAL_SPEC.md`, you'll need:
- **Supabase** project for backend
- Edge Functions for `/ask`, `/explain`, `/reminders`
- Database tables: users, messages, reminders, events
- Push notification dispatch for family alerts

#### C. Production TTS (Optional)
For premium users, integrate:
- **ElevenLabs** for higher quality voices
- Fallback to iOS native for free tier

## 🎨 Design Principles

Following the PRD vision: **"Technology that feels like care"**

- ✅ Large touch targets (44pt+) for accessibility
- ✅ Warm, friendly language in all messages
- ✅ Haptic feedback for confirmation
- ✅ Clear visual states (loading, success, error)
- ✅ Emoji for warmth and clarity
- ✅ Minimal cognitive load per screen
- ✅ Forgiving error handling

---

## 🔐 Privacy & Security

- **No Always-On Recording**: Voice only records when button pressed
- **Local Storage**: All data stored on device via AsyncStorage
- **Minimal Data Collection**: Only what's needed for features
- **No Permanent Audio**: Recordings deleted after transcription
- **Transparent Permissions**: Clear explanations for each request
- **User Control**: Easy toggles for all safety features

## 💰 Production Costs (Estimated)

Per PRD Phase 3 pricing:

| Service | Free Tier | Plus ($9.99/mo) | Cost per User/Month |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|---------------------|
| OpenAI API | 10 queries | Unlimited | $1.50 |
| TTS | iOS Native | ElevenLabs | $0.30 (premium) |
| SMS Alerts | - | Included | $0.50 |
| **Gross Margin** | - | **$8.49 (85%)** | - |

## 🐛 Known Limitations (MVP)

1. **Mock AI Responses**: Not connected to real GPT API
2. **Mock Transcription**: Uses random test phrases
3. **Mock OCR**: Returns sample summaries
4. **Local Only**: No backend sync yet
5. **Single User**: No multi-device support
6. **iOS Only**: Android not yet implemented

These will be addressed in Phase 2 per the migration plan.

## 🎯 Success Metrics to Track

Per PRD goals:

| Metric | Target | How to Measure |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Task completion (≤2 taps) | ≥90% | Analytics on user flows |
| Daily engagement | ≥5 days/week | Check-in frequency |
| Retention (3 months) | ≥70% | Cohort analysis |
| NPS | ≥50 | In-app surveys |
| Fall alert accuracy | ≥90% | True positive rate |
| False positives | ≤5% | User feedback |
