# 🎯 Next Steps for Milo - You're Almost There!

## ✅ What's Done

- ✅ Dependencies installed
- ✅ EAS CLI installed locally
- ✅ Build configuration created (`eas.json`)
- ✅ Project structure ready

## 🚀 What You Need To Do Now (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Login to Expo (1 min)

```bash
npx eas-cli login
```

**Don't have an Expo account?**
- Create free account at: https://expo.dev
- Or run: `npx eas-cli register`

### Step 2: Initialize Project (1 min)

```bash
npx eas-cli init
```

This creates your project and gives you a **Project ID**.

### Step 3: Update app.json (30 sec)

Copy the Project ID from Step 2 and paste it in `app.json`:

```json
"extra": {
  "eas": {
    "projectId": "PASTE-YOUR-PROJECT-ID-HERE"
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Build! (2 min to start)

```bash
npm run build:dev
```

The build will:
- Run on Expo's servers (not your Mac)
- Take 15-20 minutes for first build
- Give you a download link when done

### Step 5: Install on iPhone

When build finishes:
1. Open the link on your iPhone
2. Download and install
3. Trust certificate in Settings
4. Open app and sign up!

## 📋 Complete Command Sequence

Copy and run these one at a time:

```bash
# 1. Login
npx eas-cli login

# 2. Initialize (copy the project ID it shows)
npx eas-cli init

# 3. Build
npm run build:dev
```

## ⏭️ After Installation

1. **Grant notification permissions** when app asks
2. **Sign up** on each family member's phone:
   - Mom: Role = "Mom"
   - You: Role = "Family"
   - Sister: Role = "Family"
3. **Test it**: Mom taps "I'm OK" → You get notified!
